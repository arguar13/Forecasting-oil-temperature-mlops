"""Simple data drift check for batch inference.

It loads the reference profile logged with the model (mean/std per sensor,
computed once from the training data), compares a new batch of readings
against it with a per-feature z-score, and logs the result.

It intentionally does NOT retrain, alert an external system, or store any
state between runs -- it only answers "does this batch still look like
the data the model was trained on?" and reports the answer. Deciding what
to do about a drift report (investigate, retrain, ignore) is left to a
human. For a project at this scale, that is enough: no message queue, no
extra database table, no cooldown/ceiling bookkeeping to maintain.
